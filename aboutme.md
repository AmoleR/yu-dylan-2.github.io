Hello! My name is Dylan, and I have an interest in many subjects, including: 
- Mathematics: My first love - it's fun to play with numbers, and even more fun to write about them!
- Physics: My favorite scientist of all time is Richard Feynman. Check out his artwork, it's great!
- Computer Science: CS is extremely versatile, and it's what helped make this website!
- Economics: Slowly converting my stocks to bonds (just kidding, I don't have any of either).

My main website can be found [here](http://yu-dylan.github.io/).
